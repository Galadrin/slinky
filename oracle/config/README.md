The entire oracle configuration is broken down into two files:

1. **Oracle side-car configuration (oracle.toml):** This contains the data provider's that are utilized, the desired markets to be requested, metrics instrumentation, and more.
2. **Oracle configuration in the application (app.toml):** A few additional lines of code that must be added to the application's `app.toml` file to configure the oracle side car into the application.

## `app.toml`

The `app.toml` file is the configuration file that is consumed by the application. This file contains over-arching configurations for your entire Cosmos SDK application, as well as a few new configurations for the oracle. You must use this template to add the oracle configurations to your `app.toml` file:

## `oracle.toml`

The `oracle.toml` file is the configuration file that is consumed by the oracle side-car. This file contains:

* The desired data providers to be utilized.
	* Each provider has its own configurations based on whether it is an API provider or a WebSocket provider.
	* Each 
* The desired markets to be requested
* Metrics instrumentation


# Oracle Configuration

The main oracle configuration object is located in [oracle.go](oracle.go). This is utilized to set up the oracle, whether in process or out of process, and to configure the providers that the oracle will use. The object is defined as follows:

```go
type OracleConfig struct {
	// Enabled specifies whether the side-car oracle needs to be run.
	Enabled bool `mapstructure:"enabled" toml:"enabled"`
    
	// InProcess specifies whether the oracle configured, is currently running as a remote grpc-server, or will be run in process
	InProcess bool `mapstructure:"in_process" toml:"in_process"`
	
    // RemoteAddress is the address of the remote oracle server (if it is running out-of-process)
	RemoteAddress string `mapstructure:"remote_address" toml:"remote_address"`
	
    // Timeout is the time that the client is willing to wait for responses from the oracle before timing out.
	Timeout time.Duration `mapstructure:"timeout" toml:"timeout"`
	
    // UpdateInterval is the interval at which the oracle will fetch prices from providers
	UpdateInterval time.Duration `mapstructure:"update_interval" toml:"update_interval"`
	
    // Providers is the list of providers that the oracle will fetch prices from.
	Providers []ProviderConfig `mapstructure:"providers" toml:"providers"`
	
    // CurrencyPairs is the list of currency pairs that the oracle will fetch prices for.
	CurrencyPairs []oracletypes.CurrencyPair `mapstructure:"currency_pairs" toml:"currency_pairs"`
}
```

## Enabled

This flag is utilized to note whether the oracle side car needs to be run. **In the case of staked validator, this must be set to true with correct configurations for all remaining fields.** In the case of a non-validator, this can be set to false, and the oracle side car will not be run.

## InProcess

This flag is utilized to note whether the oracle side car is running in process or out of process. If this flag is set to true, then the oracle side car will be run in process, and the remaining fields will be used to configure the oracle. If this flag is set to false, then the `Providers`, `CurrencyPairs`, and `UpdateInterval` fields will be unused as these *must* be configured on the out-of-process oracle that is running.

## RemoteAddress

This field is utilized to set the address of the remote oracle server. This field is only used if the oracle is running out of process. If the oracle is running in process, then this field is not used. The out-of-process oracle server must be correctly configured with the correct providers and currency pairs.

## Timeout

This field is utilized to set the timeout for the oracle client. This is the time that the oracle client will wait for a response from the oracle server before timing out i.e. how long will [`ExtendVote`](../../abci/ve/vote_extension.go) wait for a response from the oracle server before timing out.

## UpdateInterval

This field is utilized to set the interval at which the oracle will fetch prices from providers. In the case where a provider fails to respond, the oracle will wait until the next update interval to fetch prices from the provider again.

## Providers

This field is utilized to set the list of providers that the oracle will fetch prices from. Please read the [Create Your Own Provider](../../providers/README.md) readme to learn more about how to configure a provider.

## CurrencyPairs

This field is utilized to set the list of currency pairs that the oracle will fetch prices for. These should be the same exact currency pairs that the oracle module (`x/oracle`) is currently configured to accept.

## Example Configuration

# Instrumentation Configuration

> **This section only applies if you are running a validator and the oracle side-car.** If you are running a non-validator node, you can skip this section.

There two types of oracle instrumentations that can be configured: **app-side oracle metrics** and **oracle side-car metrics**. The metrics configuration can be found in [metrics.go](metrics.go). The metrics configuration object is defined as follows:

```go
type MetricsConfig struct {
	// PrometheusServerAddress is the address of the prometheus server that the oracle will expose metrics to
	PrometheusServerAddress string `mapstructure:"prometheus_server_address" toml:"prometheus_server_address"`
	// OracleMetrics is the config for the oracle metrics
	OracleMetrics oracle_metrics.Config `mapstructure:"oracle_metrics" toml:"oracle_metrics"`
	// AppMetrics is the config for the app metrics
	AppMetrics service_metrics.Config `mapstructure:"app_metrics" toml:"app_metrics"`
}
```

## PrometheusServerAddress

This field is utilized to set the address of the prometheus server that will expose these metrics.

## App Metrics

The oracle's `VoteExtensionHandler` and `PreBlockHandler` both utilize the `OracleMetrics` object to instrument how the oracle is interacting with the base app. This allow's us to internally track how long it takes to fetch prices from the oracle service, how frequently a given validator's prices are included in blocks, and more. The `OracleMetrics` object is defined as follows:

```go
type Config struct {
	// Enabled indicates whether metrics should be enabled
	Enabled bool `mapstructure:"enabled" toml:"enabled"`
}
```

### Enabled

This flag is utilized to note whether the app-side oracle metrics should be enabled.

## Oracle Metrics

The oracle side-car metrics track's various information about the health of the side-car, including how frequently providers are successfully updating prices, how frequently the oracle is successfully updating prices, and more. The `OracleMetrics` object is defined as follows:

```go
type Config struct {
	// Enabled indicates whether metrics should be enabled
	Enabled bool `mapstructure:"enabled" toml:"enabled"`
}
```

### Enabled

This flag is utilized to note whether the oracle-side car metrics should be enabled.


## Example Configuration

```toml
